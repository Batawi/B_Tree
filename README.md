# B-Tree implementation based on two disk files. 
One file contains nodes, pointers to children and pointers to records. Second file contains only records. Both files are binary.

At any time during the program operation operating memory (RAM) contains the number of nodes which won't exceed height of the tree.

Use `make` to compile. If you don't want to edit the proper `#define`, `files` folder must be created. Press `h` for help window to pop up.
